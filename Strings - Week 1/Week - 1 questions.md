### 1. [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/) - Easy üü¢


This question is asked by **Google** . Given a string, reverse all of its characters and return the resulting string.

    Ex: Given the following strings...

    ‚ÄúCat‚Äù, return ‚ÄútaC‚Äù

    ‚ÄúThe Daily Byte‚Äù, return "etyB yliaD ehT‚Äù

    ‚Äúcivic‚Äù, return ‚Äúcivic‚Äù

### 2. [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/) - Easy üü¢

This question is asked by **Facebook**. Given a string, return whether or not it forms a palindrome ignoring case and non-alphabetical characters. 

Note: a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards. 

    Ex: Given the following strings...
    
    "level", return true
    
    "algorithm", return false
    
    "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama.", return true

### 3. [Robot Return to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-return-to-origin/) - Easy üü¢

This question is asked by **Amazon**. Given a string representing the sequence of moves a robot vacuum makes, return whether or not it will return to its original position.

The string will only contain L, R, U, and D characters, representing left, right, up, and down respectively.

    Ex: Given the following strings...
    
    "LR", return true
    
    "URURD", return false
    
    "RUULLDRD", return true

### 4. [Detect Capital](https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-capital/) - Easy üü¢

This question is asked by **Google**. Given a string, return whether or not it uses capitalization correctly.

A string correctly uses capitalization if all letters are capitalized, no letters are capitalized, or only the first letter is capitalized.

    Ex: Given the following strings...

    "USA", return true

    "Calvin", return true

    "compUter", return false

    "coding", return true

### 5. [Add Binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/) - Easy üü¢

This question is asked by **Apple**. Given two binary strings (strings containing only 1s and 0s) return their sum (also as a binary string). 

Note: neither binary string will contain leading 0s unless the string itself is 0 

    Ex: Given the following binary strings...

    "100" + "1", return "101"

    "11" + "1", return "100"

    "1" + "0", return  "1"

### 6. [Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/) - Easy üü¢

This question is asked by **Microsoft**. Given an array of strings, return the longest common prefix that is shared amongst all strings. 

Note: you may assume all strings only contain lowercase alphabetical characters. 

    Ex: Given the following arrays...
    
    ["colorado", "color", "cold"], return "col"
    
    ["a", "b", "c"], return ""
    
    ["spot", "spotty", "spotted"], return "spot"
    
[Solution](https://github.com/AlbusDracoSam/DailyByte/blob/main/Strings%20-%20Week%201/6.%20Longest%20Common%20Prefix.java)

### 7. [Valid Palindrome ii](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/) - Easy üü¢

This question is asked by **Facebook**. Given a string and the ability to delete at most one character, return whether or not it can form a palindrome. 

Note: a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards. 

    Ex: Given the following strings...
    
    "abcba", return true
    
    "foobof", return true (remove the first 'o', the second 'o', or 'b')
    
    "abccab", return false
