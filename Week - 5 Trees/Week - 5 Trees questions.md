### 1. [Search in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/) - Easy üü¢

This question is asked by **Google.**

Given the reference to the root of a binary search tree and a search value, return the reference to the node that contains the value if it exists and null otherwise. 

Note: all values in the binary search tree will be unique. 

    Ex: Given the tree...
            3
           / \
          1   4
    and the search value 1 return a reference to the node containing 1.
    
    Ex: Given the following tree...
            7
           / \
          5   9
             / \ 
            8   10
    and the search value 9 return a reference to the node containing 9.
    
    Ex: Given the following tree...
            8
           / \
          6   9
    and the search value 7 return null.

### 2. [Convert Sorted Array to BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/) - Easy üü¢

Given a binary search tree, rearrange the tree such that it forms a linked list where all its values are in ascending order.

    Ex: Given the following tree...
            5
           / \
          1   6
    return...
    1
     \
      5
       \
        6
       
    Ex: Given the following tree...
           5
          / \
        2    9
       / \ 
      1   3 
    return...
    1
     \
      2
       \
        3
         \
          5
           \
            9
            
    Ex: Given the following tree...
    5
     \
      6
    return...
    5
     \
      6

### 3. [Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/) - Easy üü¢

Given a binary search tree that contains unique values and two nodes within the tree, a, and b, return their lowest common ancestor. 

Note: the lowest common ancestor of two nodes is the deepest node within the tree such that both nodes are descendants of it.

    Ex: Given the following tree...
           7
          / \
        2    9
       / \ 
      1   5 
    and a = 1, b = 9, return a reference to the node containing 7.
    
    Ex: Given the following tree...
            8
           / \
          3   9
         / \ 
        2   6
    and a = 2, b = 6, return a reference to the node containing 3.
    
    Ex: Given the following tree...
            8
           / \
          6   9
    and a = 6, b = 8, return a reference to the node containing 8.
